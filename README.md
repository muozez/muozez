### Hi there, I'm Muhammet Yılmaz 👋

I'm a **Systems Architect** and **Platform Engineer** with a core belief: the best code is the infrastructure that makes other developers' lives easier. 

My journey started in a different field of engineering, which taught me one thing: I'm not passionate about building physical machines, I'm passionate about building the **invisible, self-healing, and scalable digital factories** that power our world.

I see technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, and Node.js not as career titles, but as tools in an arsenal to build powerful, automated systems from the ground up. My goal is to move beyond just being a *user* of technology and become a *creator* of tools that enable others to build.

- 🔭 I’m currently building **[EnvZilla](https://github.com/EnvZilla/envzilla)**, a GitOps tool to create ephemeral preview environments for pull requests.
- 🌱 I’m currently going deep on **Kubernetes (K8s)** architecture and **Go (Golang)** for high-performance networking services.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in the Cloud Native & DevOps space.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to system design, CI/CD, and building scalable backends.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe the best way to understand a system is to build it from scratch, fail, and then build it again, but smarter.

### 🏛️ My Philosophy & Approach

* **Automation First, Always.** If a task needs to be done more than twice, it must be automated. My goal is to build systems that run themselves, freeing up human creativity for problems that matter.
* **Architecture is the Foundation.** A brilliant feature on a shaky foundation is worthless. I believe in designing for scale, resilience, and security from day one.
* **Build in Public.** Sharing knowledge, open-sourcing projects, and documenting the journey are the best ways to learn and grow. The "black box" era is over.
* **Pragmatism over Dogma.** The best tool is the one that solves the problem efficiently. I value clean code and robust systems, but I also value delivering results.
